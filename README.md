# LLM Transceiver Example

This is an example implementation of an LLM (Large Language Model) transceiver, which enables users to submit prompts and stream prompts (and outputs) using WebRTC connections. This code serves as a starting point for building your own LLM-based communication system.


What this code does


This repository contains a Python class that establishes WebRTC connections with a server and enables bidirectional communication between the user and the LLM. The code allows users to submit prompts, receive responses from the LLM, and stream outputs in real-time.


How to use this code



Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/LLM-Transceiver-Example.git

Install required dependencies: pip install websockets

Run the code: python main.py


Features and limitations



Supports bidirectional communication between user and LLM

Allows for submission of prompts and streaming of outputs (and responses)

Demonstrates use of WebRTC connections for real-time communication


Note: This is an example implementation, and you will need to modify the code to suit your specific use case. You may also want to add additional features, such as error handling, logging, or security measures.


Next steps



Customize this code to fit your project's requirements

Test and refine the code for robustness and performance

Integrate with your LLM model and server implementation
